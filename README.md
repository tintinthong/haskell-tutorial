- [_:xs] and (x:_) Do not be confused by the blank variables. Always the second variable in a list type construct is the big list and the other is the head. Syntactic sugar for x:[],x:[xs]
- Expressions can be put anywhere (if..else and let..in). Where is slightly less general.
- Pattern matching is just syntactic sugar for case expressions
